                                        chosen for assessment when using third-party quality inspection services.
                                        Samples are examined for appearance, appropriate functionality, packaging
                                        integrity,
                                        craftsmanship, and the particular needs of the customer using a thorough
                                        inspection plan.
                                        Depending on the inspection plan, problems are categorised as major, minor, or
                                        critical.

                                        First Article Inspection (FAI) is a comprehensive and systematic verification
                                        process used in manufacturing and
                                        production industries. It involves inspecting and validating the first
                                        manufactured part or product from a new
                                        production run or process to ensure that it meets all specified design
                                        requirements, engineering drawings, and
                                        standards. The purpose of FAI is to confirm that the initial product from a new
                                        production line or process meets the
                                        intended design, and any necessary adjustments or corrections can be made before
                                        mass production.<br><br>
